Take your standard web app (i.e. React, Vue, Next, Angular, etc.) and convert
each individual component (button, div, etc.) into it's own dedicated Angular
application. Convert each component application into individual WASM modules via
wasm-bindgen (using a highly performant Rust build server), and import each
module application into a mothership Angular application using
WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming()., where the target is all your WASM modules.
CSS becomes optimized by converting every key-value into respective hexadecimal
values. :rare_kek: If you ever change a single element, you dont have to
recompile your entire application -- just the individual WASM module.
