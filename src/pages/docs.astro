    <h2 class="text-3xl font-normal">Key Features</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc">
      <li>
        <strong>Enhanced Performance:</strong> Rustular harnesses the power of Rust
        and WebAssembly to deliver lightning-fast web applications. The use of highly
        performant Rust build servers and WebAssembly modules ensures optimal performance
        and efficient resource utilization.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Modular Architecture:</strong> Rustular embraces modularity by converting
        each individual component of a web app into its own dedicated Angular application.
        This approach allows for easy maintenance, code reuse, and independent updates
        to specific components without the need for recompiling the entire application.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Seamless Integration:</strong> With Rustular, integrating WebAssembly
        modules into your Angular application is a breeze. The use of <code
          >WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming()</code
        > enables effortless integration and dynamic loading of the component modules,
        resulting in a seamless and efficient development experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>CSS Optimization:</strong> Rustular optimizes CSS styling by converting
        key-value pairs into respective hexadecimal values. This approach streamlines
        the rendering process and improves overall application performance.
      </li>
    </ul>
