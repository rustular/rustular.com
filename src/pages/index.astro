    <div class="text-2xl">The idea!</div>
    <div class="mx-auto max-w-xl font-thin">
      Take your standard web app (i.e. React, Vue, Next, Angular, etc.) and
      convert each individual component (button, div, etc.) into it's own
      dedicated Angular application. Convert each component application into
      individual WASM modules via wasm-bindgen (using a highly performant Rust
      build server), and import each module application into a mothership
      Angular application using WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(), where the
      target is all your WASM modules. CSS becomes optimized by converting every
      key-value into respective hexadecimal values. If you ever change a single
      element, you dont have to recompile your entire application -- just the
      individual WASM module.
